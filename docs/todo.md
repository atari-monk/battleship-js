## Player indicators 

Yes, using color-coded borders is a good idea. You can also add:  

1. **Background Tint**: Slightly tint the background (light blue for the player, light red for AI).  
2. **Turn Indicator**: A text label at the top or bottom ("Your Turn" in blue, "AI's Turn" in red).  
3. **Grid Highlight**: A subtle glow or shadow around the grid in the active color.  
4. **Animation**: A smooth transition effect (like fading or pulsing) when switching turns.  
5. **Icon or Symbol**: Show a small icon in a corner (e.g., a human silhouette for the player, a robot for AI).  

Combining a few of these can make the turn-switching feel more natural. Would you prefer a more minimal or more obvious visual cue?

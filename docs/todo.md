## Player indicators 

Yes, using color-coded borders is a good idea. You can also add:  

1. **Background Tint**: Slightly tint the background (light blue for the player, light red for AI).  
2. **Turn Indicator**: A text label at the top or bottom ("Your Turn" in blue, "AI's Turn" in red).  
3. **Grid Highlight**: A subtle glow or shadow around the grid in the active color.  
4. **Animation**: A smooth transition effect (like fading or pulsing) when switching turns.  
5. **Icon or Symbol**: Show a small icon in a corner (e.g., a human silhouette for the player, a robot for AI).  

Combining a few of these can make the turn-switching feel more natural. Would you prefer a more minimal or more obvious visual cue?

## Code quality

Sure! If you’re wondering whether you’re a bad coder, the first step is to define what "bad" means. Are you struggling with debugging? Writing messy code? Having trouble with algorithms? Or maybe you’re comparing yourself to others?  

A few ways to evaluate yourself:  

1. **Code Readability** – Do others understand your code easily? Is it well-structured?  
2. **Bug Frequency** – Do you frequently introduce hard-to-find bugs?  
3. **Problem-Solving Skills** – Can you break down problems logically?  
4. **Efficiency** – Do you write inefficient code when better solutions exist?  
5. **Code Maintainability** – Would you or someone else be able to update your code later without major issues?  
6. **Understanding Core Concepts** – Do you understand the fundamentals of programming, data structures, and algorithms?  

If you're struggling in some areas, it doesn’t mean you’re bad—it just means there’s room to grow, which is normal. Do you have a specific concern or example of your code that you feel unsure about?

# SRP Refactor

## Question 1

Analyze the following code based on the 'Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.' principle:

```javascript
export class ActionService {
  constructor(gameStateService, { endTurn, win }) {
    this._gameStateService = gameStateService
    this._actions = {
      endTurn: () => endTurn.endTurn(),
      win: () => win.win(),
    }
  }

  action() {
    this._actions[this._gameStateService.nextAction()]()
  }
}
```

## Solution 1

Below is one way to refactor the original code into multiple classes, each with a single responsibility. In this example, we separate:

1. **ActionRegistry:** Responsible for registering and retrieving actions.
2. **ActionResolver:** Responsible for determining which action should be executed based on the game state.
3. **ActionExecutor:** Responsible for executing the action thatâ€™s been resolved.

### Step 1: Define the ActionRegistry

This class handles the registration and lookup of actions.

```javascript
export class ActionRegistry {
  constructor() {
    this._actions = new Map();
  }

  register(actionName, actionFn) {
    this._actions.set(actionName, actionFn);
  }

  getAction(actionName) {
    return this._actions.get(actionName);
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Define the ActionResolver

This class encapsulates the logic for determining the next action, which is delegated to the game state service.

```javascript
export class ActionResolver {
  constructor(gameStateService) {
    this._gameStateService = gameStateService;
  }

  resolve() {
    // Returns a string representing the action name (e.g., "endTurn", "win")
    return this._gameStateService.nextAction();
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Define the ActionExecutor

This class uses the registry and the resolver to execute the appropriate action.

```javascript
export class ActionExecutor {
  constructor(actionRegistry, actionResolver) {
    this._actionRegistry = actionRegistry;
    this._actionResolver = actionResolver;
  }

  execute() {
    const actionName = this._actionResolver.resolve();
    const action = this._actionRegistry.getAction(actionName);
    if (action) {
      action();
    } else {
      throw new Error(`No action registered for: ${actionName}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### Putting It All Together

Below is an example of how you might set up and use these classes:

```javascript
// Assume these are provided by other parts of your application
const gameStateService = {
  // For example, nextAction returns a string indicating the next action.
  nextAction() {
    return "endTurn"; // This could be dynamic in a real scenario.
  },
};

const endTurn = {
  endTurn() {
    console.log("Turn ended!");
  },
};

const win = {
  win() {
    console.log("You win!");
  },
};

// Create and set up the registry.
const actionRegistry = new ActionRegistry();
actionRegistry.register("endTurn", endTurn.endTurn);
actionRegistry.register("win", win.win);

// Create the resolver using the game state service.
const actionResolver = new ActionResolver(gameStateService);

// Create the executor with the registry and resolver.
const actionExecutor = new ActionExecutor(actionRegistry, actionResolver);

// Execute the resolved action.
actionExecutor.execute();  // Output: "Turn ended!"
```

### Explanation

- **ActionRegistry** is solely responsible for the mapping of action names to functions. If new actions are added or the mapping logic changes, only this class is affected.
- **ActionResolver** is responsible for extracting the next action from the game state. Changes in how the next action is determined will only impact this class.
- **ActionExecutor** ties everything together by retrieving the correct action using the resolver and registry, then executing it. Its responsibility is limited to the execution flow.

By splitting the responsibilities in this way, each class has one clear reason to change, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

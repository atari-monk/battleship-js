Sure! If you’re wondering whether you’re a bad coder, the first step is to define what "bad" means. Are you struggling with debugging? Writing messy code? Having trouble with algorithms? Or maybe you’re comparing yourself to others?  

A few ways to evaluate yourself:  

1. **Code Readability** – Do others understand your code easily? Is it well-structured?  
2. **Bug Frequency** – Do you frequently introduce hard-to-find bugs?  
3. **Problem-Solving Skills** – Can you break down problems logically?  
4. **Efficiency** – Do you write inefficient code when better solutions exist?  
5. **Code Maintainability** – Would you or someone else be able to update your code later without major issues?  
6. **Understanding Core Concepts** – Do you understand the fundamentals of programming, data structures, and algorithms?  

If you're struggling in some areas, it doesn’t mean you’re bad—it just means there’s room to grow, which is normal. Do you have a specific concern or example of your code that you feel unsure about?
